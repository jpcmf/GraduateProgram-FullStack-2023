# Design de UI

## Aula 01 - Joe Natoli

### Prototyping

#### What exactly is a prototype?

A prototype is a **simulation** of a finished product.
- represents how **interaction** between the user + the interface would work.
- serves as an imitation of how the real-world **processes** underneath the UI would work.
- can represent a **single interaction** or an **entire app experience** from login to logout.

#### Why do we prototype? 

To **test**.

USABILITY
- will this work for users in a way they can easily understand and act upon?
- does it surface action and information where, when and how they need it?

FEASIBILITY
- is it possible to actually build this?
- do we have the time, budget, resources, knowledge and access to technology?

VIABILITY
- how will we support + improve this?

#### Prototyping ensures we get it right.

We test ideas with real users, so we can see how they expect + want to use the product. prototypes tell us:
- if what they **expect** is what they **get**
- what’s easy to use + understand
- where, how + why they get stuck or tripped up or confused or frustrated

#### Testing reveals the parts that need improvement.

we’re finding + resolving usability issues well before launch.

this allows us to adjust the design, test again + keep doing so until we get it right.

#### Create, test, learn, revise, repeat.

**create** the solution, exploring content, interaction, UI + UX.

**test** the prototype with users, to **learn** how well it meets needs + expectations.

**revise** areas that need to be refined, defined, improved or clarified.

**repeat** ;-)

#### Start small.

you start with only a few **key screens** or sequences.

as you iterate + test, the prototype grows in **breadth** and **depth**; more screens, content + interaction.

along the way you make **changes to smaller details**, in real-time + across iteration cycles of days or weeks.

#### How much is enough?

usually it’s **20% of the functionality** that will be used 80% of the time.

this is the stuff you have to get right in order for people to **recognize** that the product meets their needs.

it’s the content + interactions + visual presentation that ensure they’ll be **able + willing** to use it.

#### Sequences, not screens.

you never prototype a single screen.

you prototype a sequence, a **journey**, from start to finish.

e.g. *“Joe logs in to the banking app, checks his balance and transfers money from checking to savings.”*

#### Wireframes, prototypes + mockups (oh my!)

- unlike sketches, wireframes or mockups, a prototype is an **interactive simulation**.
- sketches, wireframes and mockups are essentially **static** components.
- if you can’t tap, click or swipe through it and have it respond to those actions + gestures, **it’s not a prototype**.

#### Protoyping software

Adobe XD, UXPin, Figma, Sketch + others will export static screens to a **clickable, interactive prototype**.

you create low-fidelity wireframes + export them as a prototype.

there are many — so how do you choose the best tool to use?

#### Choose a tool that...

is **easy** for you to learn and use.

is **flexible**, meaning it can be used to create prototypes for web, desktop + mobile apps.

has a **large library** of stencils, templates + widgets, either built in or available from third parties.

makes it easy to **share** the prototype with others for testing + review.

can **capture** feedback during use.

allows **changes on the fly**, while getting feedback in a session.

allows **collaboration**, e.g. multiple people working on the prototype at the same time.

### The problems prototypes solve

#### There are two choices at the outset of a project.

1. **start building with production-ready code**, launch it and see how people react.
2. **build + test low-fidelity prototypes early + often**, to figure out what’s actually worth building.

#### Guess which approach is usually chosen?

prototyping makes a lot more sense + creates a lot less waste in terms of unnecessary work / rework.

however, far too many organizations take the first approach + **dive right into coding**.

the result?

teams are grossly **overworked + stressed out**.

they’re spending 50% or more of their time **reworking things** that either aren’t functioning properly or aren’t delivering the intended user or business results.

backlogs are growing exponentially + management isn’t getting the **results** they hoped for (usually money made or money saved).

**new requirements + requests** keep showing up even after code is committed.

emergency meetings are called; changes and revisions and rework are **endless**.

people are working themselves to death long past dark seven days a week, trying to reach a finish line that **keeps moving** every time they get close to it.

and if all of that weren’t enough, **users are frustrated** — and often angry.

they’re taking their business elsewhere.

to a competitor who isn’t using them as guinea pigs to test a bunch of new features they didn’t ask for.

there’s only one antidote.

#### Starting the minute a project becomes real.
- allows everyone to quickly get a handle on what **features + functionality** could or should be.
- how it will actually **work** when someone uses it.
- prototypes communicate the experience in UX; allows us to test its **value** and **usefulness**.

1. enables better UX + design decisions.
- critical interactive design choices can be finalized in prototyping.
- hi-fi prototypes deliver instant feedback in testing, allowing informed, educated decisions.
- instead of a guess based on “best practice” design / UX principles.

2. keeps focus on UX + context of use.
- you’re using all your senses when working with a prototype.
- so when something doesn’t work as expected, it’s real to you.
- you experience the same visceral, emotional reaction a user does.
- users normally test prototypes in a “real life” environment + context.
- external, contextual factors that affect ease of use, like distractions or noise or device limitations — are all present.
- experiences are truer to life, so your test results are more useful.

3. non-sequential + doesn’t hold up any other work.
 - developers are still coding, database folks + software architects are still working out structure + architecture.
 - “we don’t have time for prototyping, everyone else will be waiting for it to be done, or for test results.”
 - if it slows you down, you’re doing it wrong.
