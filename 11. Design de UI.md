# Design de UI

## Aula 01 - Joe Natoli

### Prototyping

#### What exactly is a prototype?

A prototype is a **simulation** of a finished product.
- represents how **interaction** between the user + the interface would work.
- serves as an imitation of how the real-world **processes** underneath the UI would work.
- can represent a **single interaction** or an **entire app experience** from login to logout.

#### Why do we prototype? 

To **test**.

USABILITY
- will this work for users in a way they can easily understand and act upon?
- does it surface action and information where, when and how they need it?

FEASIBILITY
- is it possible to actually build this?
- do we have the time, budget, resources, knowledge and access to technology?

VIABILITY
- how will we support + improve this?

#### Prototyping ensures we get it right.

We test ideas with real users, so we can see how they expect + want to use the product. prototypes tell us:
- if what they **expect** is what they **get**
- what’s easy to use + understand
- where, how + why they get stuck or tripped up or confused or frustrated

#### Testing reveals the parts that need improvement.

we’re finding + resolving usability issues well before launch.

this allows us to adjust the design, test again + keep doing so until we get it right.

#### Create, test, learn, revise, repeat.

**create** the solution, exploring content, interaction, UI + UX.

**test** the prototype with users, to **learn** how well it meets needs + expectations.

**revise** areas that need to be refined, defined, improved or clarified.

**repeat** ;-)

#### Start small.

you start with only a few **key screens** or sequences.

as you iterate + test, the prototype grows in **breadth** and **depth**; more screens, content + interaction.

along the way you make **changes to smaller details**, in real-time + across iteration cycles of days or weeks.

#### How much is enough?

usually it’s **20% of the functionality** that will be used 80% of the time.

this is the stuff you have to get right in order for people to **recognize** that the product meets their needs.

it’s the content + interactions + visual presentation that ensure they’ll be **able + willing** to use it.

#### Sequences, not screens.

you never prototype a single screen.

you prototype a sequence, a **journey**, from start to finish.

e.g. *“Joe logs in to the banking app, checks his balance and transfers money from checking to savings.”*

#### Wireframes, prototypes + mockups (oh my!)

- unlike sketches, wireframes or mockups, a prototype is an **interactive simulation**.
- sketches, wireframes and mockups are essentially **static** components.
- if you can’t tap, click or swipe through it and have it respond to those actions + gestures, **it’s not a prototype**.

#### Protoyping software

Adobe XD, UXPin, Figma, Sketch + others will export static screens to a **clickable, interactive prototype**.

you create low-fidelity wireframes + export them as a prototype.

there are many — so how do you choose the best tool to use?

#### Choose a tool that...

is **easy** for you to learn and use.

is **flexible**, meaning it can be used to create prototypes for web, desktop + mobile apps.

has a **large library** of stencils, templates + widgets, either built in or available from third parties.

makes it easy to **share** the prototype with others for testing + review.

can **capture** feedback during use.

allows **changes on the fly**, while getting feedback in a session.

allows **collaboration**, e.g. multiple people working on the prototype at the same time.

### The problems prototypes solve
