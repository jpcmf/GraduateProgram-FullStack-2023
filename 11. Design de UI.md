# Design de UI

## Aula 01 - Joe Natoli

### Prototyping

#### What exactly is a prototype?

A prototype is a **simulation** of a finished product.
- represents how **interaction** between the user + the interface would work.
- serves as an imitation of how the real-world **processes** underneath the UI would work.
- can represent a **single interaction** or an **entire app experience** from login to logout.

#### Why do we prototype? 

To **test**.

USABILITY
- will this work for users in a way they can easily understand and act upon?
- does it surface action and information where, when and how they need it?

FEASIBILITY
- is it possible to actually build this?
- do we have the time, budget, resources, knowledge and access to technology?

VIABILITY
- how will we support + improve this?
