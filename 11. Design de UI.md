# Design de UI

## Aula 01 - Joe Natoli

### Prototyping

#### What exactly is a prototype?

A prototype is a **simulation** of a finished product.
- represents how **interaction** between the user + the interface would work.
- serves as an imitation of how the real-world **processes** underneath the UI would work.
- can represent a **single interaction** or an **entire app experience** from login to logout.

#### Why do we prototype? 

To **test**.

USABILITY
- will this work for users in a way they can easily understand and act upon?
- does it surface action and information where, when and how they need it?

FEASIBILITY
- is it possible to actually build this?
- do we have the time, budget, resources, knowledge and access to technology?

VIABILITY
- how will we support + improve this?

#### Prototyping ensures we get it right.

We test ideas with real users, so we can see how they expect + want to use the product. prototypes tell us:
- if what they **expect** is what they **get**
- what’s easy to use + understand
- where, how + why they get stuck or tripped up or confused or frustrated

#### Testing reveals the parts that need improvement.

we’re finding + resolving usability issues well before launch.

this allows us to adjust the design, test again + keep doing so until we get it right.

#### Create, test, learn, revise, repeat.

**create** the solution, exploring content, interaction, UI + UX.

**test** the prototype with users, to **learn** how well it meets needs + expectations.

**revise** areas that need to be refined, defined, improved or clarified.

**repeat** ;-)

#### Start small.

you start with only a few **key screens** or sequences.

as you iterate + test, the prototype grows in **breadth** and **depth**; more screens, content + interaction.

along the way you make **changes to smaller details**, in real-time + across iteration cycles of days or weeks.
